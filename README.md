# Project for "Shape Evolution of the Interest Rate Term Structure"

This project adopts a novel approach to studying the evolution of interest rate term structure over the U.S. business cycles and to predicting recessions. Applying an effective algorithm, I classify the Treasury yield curve into distinct shapes and find the less frequent shapes intrinsically linked to the recessions in the post-WWII data. In forecasting recessions, the median-short yield spread trumps the long-short spread for horizons up to 17 months ahead and the yield curve shape is nearly impressive as the median-short spread. Overall, the yield curve shape is an informative but more succinct indicator than the spreads in studying the term structure.

# Project for "Shape Transition of the Interest Rate Term Structure"

This project classifies five shapes of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and examines their links to the macroeconomy. The analysis shows that these shapes have strong linkages to the different states of inflation and real production growth, and variations of the shapes have reliably predicted subsequent recessions. By casting the yield curve shape transition into Markov chains, the paper estimates the transition probability from one yield curve shape to another, and finds strong momentum and asymmetry in the shape migration. The Markov model can serve as a basis for predicting future yield curve movements and business cycle transitions.
