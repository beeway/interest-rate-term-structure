# Project for "Shape Transition of the Interest Rate Term Structure"

This project classifies five shapes of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and examines their links to the macroeconomy. The analysis shows that these shapes have strong linkages to the different states of inflation and real production growth, and variations of the shapes have reliably predicted subsequent recessions. By casting the yield curve shape transition into Markov chains, the paper estimates the transition probability from one yield curve shape to another, and finds strong momentum and asymmetry in the shape migration. The Markov model can serve as a basis for predicting future yield curve movements and business cycle transitions.
